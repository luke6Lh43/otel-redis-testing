# OpenTelemetry Redis Attribute Verification

This project aims to verify the attributes sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector for Redis across six of the most popular programming languages: Java, .NET, Python, PHP, Node.js, and Go. The goal is to ensure alignment with the latest versions of OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries and the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Redis.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to validate that the attributes generated by the OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries for Redis are consistent with the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Redis](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/database/redis/).

## Languages Covered

- .NET
- Python
- PHP
- Node.js
- Go

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions for each language-specific directory.
3. Run the provided scripts to collect and verify the attributes sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
4. Compare the collected attributes against the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Redis.
